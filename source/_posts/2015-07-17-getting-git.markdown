This week I decided to make Octocat and Git my friend. I want to be comfortable with Git because it is used by programmers in the real world as we saw today at Driffty. I am getting used to it and I was even able to help some of my classmates figure some things out while our instructors were busy helping someone else. I like code school because I can work there when I get ahead in class. I also like it because I can go at my own pace. At first I had some difficulty because I was not used to the format and the way the program corrects you reminded me of the way my Spanish program tells me to pay attention; however now I am okay with it. Learning git has helped me work out my fears about whether this is the right path for me. The more badges I earn in code school the more I realize that I can do this. I am really looking forward to building my website, establishing a web presence and building my business. Yay for getting Git!
