My reality presses upon me threatening to snap my spine and sap my mind. Class ends and I lay my head in a place that is no longer mine. I wonder when the knock on the door will come as those hands will give me my eviction; Now I am a true outsider. Shafts of light crack the darkness in the form of a job, but I will have to leave scantuary to pursue it. Caught Between My Dreams And My Reality.

This week I missed two days of class which is out of character for me. I am usually the first one in class and among the last to leave. Tuesday I had a job interview which went really well and left me with a puzzle to solve; do I choose a path which will ensure I can keep my apartment or do I contine down this path of my tech adventure? If I felt about coding as I feel about writing I would choose coding. However; I do not feel that and so I am caught between what this adventure could be and what my life requires. I think that I could come to be more passionate about coding if I could take it at my pace instead of feeling like I need to know all of this in eleven weeks especially when it is brand new to me. So, here I sit in class everyday wondering if I should continue to choose my tech adventure or if I should choose a different path.
