This past week we dove deeper into the yellow world of JS as we began working on our second workbook. During the time I spent examining the problems within this workbook I kept hearing the old adage "There are many ways to skin a cat"; I try not to wonder when skinning cats was a thing and instead focus on the realization that there are many ways to solve a puzzle. I like that my answers do not match my classmates. I like the uniqueness and individuality found in the truth that there are many ways to solve a puzzle. I also like that my classmates can help me reach my answers although theirs are different than mine. I am eager to experience week four.
