<li>I am grateful that I opened my eyes this morning.</li>
<li>I am grateful that I am five days into my thirty-sixth year of life.</li>
<li>I am grateful that I was brave enough to drink the Kool-Aid which has allowed me the pleasure of sitting at the picnic table writing this while enjoying the sun.</li>
<li>I am grateful for the friendships I have built with my fellow classmates and I am excited about the opportunity to watch them grow.
5.I am grateful that Perkins is open twenty-four hours and serves bottomless coffee.</li>
<li>I am grateful that this eleven weeks is only eleven weeks.
7.I am grateful that trouble don&rsquo;t last always and this to shall pass.</li>
</ol>


<p>This week has been a challenge, and though I am known for thriving on them, too many too fast leaves me cranky and out of sorts. Pressed upon me this week is the realization that even when I start work I will be living above my income by choosing to keep my current place. This opens a doorway of dilemma for me. I know that it is time to move but it is extremely difficult for me to let go of the place I have called home for five years. I know that I am making the right decision, it will take some time for me to accept that there is a time for everything. Now is the time for me to downsize and prepare myself for the next steps in my journey. I will not let this apartment be the reason I am unable to reach my goal of driving and I will not let this apartment be the reason I am forced to remain on Social Security. I want more from my life and I am not afraid to work for it. Hard work is one of the things I thrive on and the decision to continue drinking the Kool Aid has been a good one though right now it is not reflected in my report card. I am going to turn this around this week because my personal issues have finally receded to the point where they will not effect my performance. I am someone used to performing at the top of my game and I will be there again. It is my sincere hope that when I get an internship it will be a training one. That way I can continue developing my skills as I carve out a life for myself.</p>
