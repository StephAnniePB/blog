    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My reality presses upon me threatening to snap my spine and sap my mind. Class ends and I lay my head in a place that is no longer mine. I wonder when the knock on the door will come as those hands will give me my eviction; Now I am a true outsider. Shafts of light crack the darkness in the form of a job, but I will have to leave scantuary to pursue it. Caught Between My Dreams And My Reality.</p>

<p>This week I missed two days of class which is out of character for me. I am usually the first one in class and among the last to leave. Tuesday I had a job interview which went really well and left me with a puzzle to solve; do I choose a path which will ensure I can keep my apartment or do I contine down this path of my tech adventure? If I felt about coding as I feel about writing I would choose coding. However; I do not feel that and so I am caught between what this adventure could be and what my life requires. I think that I could come to be more passionate about coding if I could take it at my pace instead of feeling like I need to know all of this in eleven weeks especially when it is brand new to me. So, here I sit in class everyday wondering if I should continue to choose my tech adventure or if I should choose a different path.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past week we dove deeper into the yellow world of JS as we began working on our second workbook. During the time I spent examining the problems within this workbook I kept hearing the old adage &ldquo;There are many ways to skin a cat&rdquo;; I try not to wonder when skinning cats was a thing and instead focus on the realization that there are many ways to solve a puzzle. I like that my answers do not match my classmates. I like the uniqueness and individuality found in the truth that there are many ways to solve a puzzle. I also like that my classmates can help me reach my answers although theirs are different than mine. I am eager to experience week four.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week we have dived into the bright yellow world of JS. This world is bright yellow because our textbook &ldquo;Eloquent Javascript&rdquo; is that color. I am excited to gain a deeper understanding of the book that sat on my nightstand surrounded by my beloved fiction for serveral months.
I had opened it before Monday; but on Monday the language shifted from Heiroglyphics to English. I love that I had taken logic classes as a student because it made working with chapter one a review. Feeling this way about chapter one made it easier to seek out the challenge of code school. I discovered code school when my teacher sent me an invite through Gmail. I like the program and it is teaching me a lot. I am excited to use it but sometimes I wish I had more examples of how things should be done. This weekend I am going to start reading chapter two and see if I can work on learning Git some more.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>  Welcome to my tech adventure! I am a writer so the thing that drew me to this class was the opportunity to learn how to create a website to house my writing in the form of short stories, poems, and a memoir. I have never been exposed to coding before and though I know my way around Word, Excel, Adobe etc. I was eager to see if I can build a career around the brains of the internet. I am never one to back down from a challenge and after completing the first week of this academy I feel as if I can be successful.
  Today, I was able to follow a set of directions completely on my own. It was a great confidence boost to sit down on my MacBook and create a github repository I am eager to see where this journey will take me. I want to be able to create websites that are easy for the public to navigate and that draw you into the organizations you are researching. I have an interest in grant writing and fundraising so I think a lot about how to draw the public into different causes.It is very difficult for me as a grant writer to tell a potential donor to look at our website if it is not &ldquo;people friendly&rdquo;. This is a passion and I am very excited to see what tools I can use to combat this problem and also I want a spring board into freedom.
  I am learning some new things that I can add to my tech bag and I am being reminded of some old favorites. The academy reminded me of Google Docs. I am still working on learning my way around this feature being that I am old school. Meaning I like carrying flash drives around on my key chain.  I am using Trello and Harvest. I am using Slacker and playing around with my Mac AirBook. I really like that we use Mac in class because it gives me an opportunity to familiarize myself with the system and build a new skill.</p>
